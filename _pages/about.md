I received my Ph.D in Tsinghua University advised by Jiaguang Sun and Yu Jiang, in 2024. I'm interested in the research of the new design and the security of blockchain systems. In 2021, I was chosen to be the MVP of FISCO-BCOS community. In addition, I was selected into Tencent Elite Talent Training Program in 2020. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, please feel free to contact with me.
